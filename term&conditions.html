            <p>3.We shall notify the customer of an estimated completion time. The stated estimation time may vary based on the availability of the spare parts and the occurrence of secondary issue(s) (if any), and is hence not a binding obligation on Alpine Care.</p>
            <p>4.Under certain extenuating circumstances, if we are not able to complete the stipulated repair(s), or if we deem that to complete the repair(s), additional costs may have to be incurred by the customer, we shall duly apprise the customer of any such notifications with immediate effect.</p>

In such a scenario, the customer shall not incur any diagnosis surcharge.</p>
            <p>6.The status of the repair process shall be notified to the customer via Call/SMS/E-Mail/My Account page on the Website. Our customer service representative shall contact the customer regarding the delivery of the device to their desired location.</p>

            <p>11.On all repairs made by Alpine Care, for all the component(s)/spares(s) that are replaced during the course of the repair process, we shall provide a part replacement warranty of 30 days, and a service warranty of 90 days, which comes into effect from the invoice date.</p>
